2# 🚀 Quick Start Checklist - Gary Of Cinema Website

## ✅ Week 1 Priorities (MOST IMPORTANT)

### 1. Create Your First Case Study (2-3 hours)

This is THE #1 priority. One detailed case study is worth more than 20 gallery images.

**Steps:**

1. Open [portfolio/case-study-template.html](portfolio/case-study-template.html)
2. Save as `portfolio/case-study-[your-project-name].html`
3. Fill in ALL sections with your actual project details
4. Replace placeholder images with your work
5. Add specific metrics/results (even estimates are fine)

**Which project to start with?**
→ Pick the one you're most proud of OR the one most relevant to internships you want

**Resources:**

- Full instructions in [WEBSITE_TRANSFORMATION_GUIDE.md](WEBSITE_TRANSFORMATION_GUIDE.md) (Section Phase 1.1)
- Template already created for you at [portfolio/case-study-template.html](portfolio/case-study-template.html)

---

### 2. Request Testimonials (30 minutes)

Send emails to 3 people TODAY asking for testimonials.

**Who to ask:**

- [ ] A professor from a design/video class
- [ ] A client (if you have any)
- [ ] A team member from a group project

**Email template is in the guide** - just copy, personalize, and send!

**After you get them:**

1. Edit [index.html](index.html) line 522
2. Remove `style="display: none;"`
3. Fill in testimonial-card templates with real quotes

Update ALL project descriptions with results/impact.

**Files to update:**

- [ ] [portfolio.html](portfolio.html) - All portfolio categories

**Every project should answer:**

1. What problem did this solve?
2. What was your role?

## 📋 Content Reminders

### When Writing About Your Work, Always Include:

**The 3 Essential Questions:**

1. ❓ What problem did this solve?
2. ❓ How did I solve it? (show your process)
3. ❓ What impact did it have? (quantify if possible)

**Good Example:**

> "Performance-optimized portfolio website that reduced bounce rate by 40% and
> increased client inquiries. Mobile-first responsive design with smooth animations,
> fast load times (< 2s), and intuitive navigation that guides visitors to conversion."

**Bad Example:**

> "Portfolio website with animations and responsive design."

## 🎯 One-Week Sprint Plan

If you only have one week, do this:

**Day 1-2:** Create one amazing case study
**Day 3:** Request testimonials from 3 people
**Day 4:** Add metrics to all existing projects
**Day 5:** Compress and optimize images
**Day 6:** Test on mobile, check performance
**Day 7:** Get feedback and make final tweaks

## 🔥 The Absolute Minimum (If You're Rushed)

**Can't do everything? At minimum, do these 3 things:**

1. **Create ONE detailed case study** (2-3 hours)

   - Shows employers you can solve problems, not just make pretty things

2. **Add results to ALL project descriptions** (30 minutes)

   - Even rough estimates are better than nothing

3. **Get ONE good testimonial** (15 minutes to request)
   - Builds credibility and trust

These 3 things will have 10x more impact than anything else.
