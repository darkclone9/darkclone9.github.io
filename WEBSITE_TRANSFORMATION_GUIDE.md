For your top 3-5 projects, create pages following this structure:

```markdown
## Project Name

### The Challenge
What problem did the client/project have?
Example: "A local nonprofit needed to increase donor engagement..."

What specifically did you do?
Example: "I led the complete brand refresh including logo design,
website redesign, and social media template system."

### The Process
Show your thinking:
- Research and competitive analysis
- Sketches and iterations
- Design decisions and rationale
- Tools and techniques used

[Include: sketches, wireframes, before/after, process shots]

### The Solution
Present final work with high-quality images
- Screenshots
- Photos
- Video walkthroughs if applicable

### The Impact
Quantify results (even estimates):
- "Increased social media engagement by 40%"
- "Helped secure grant funding"
- "Improved user satisfaction scores"
- "Reduced bounce rate from 80% to 45%"

Include testimonial quote here if available.
```

**Where to Start:**

- Clients (if you have any)
- Team members from group projects

**How to Ask:**
Email template:
```
Subject: Quick favor - testimonial for my portfolio?

Hi [Name],

I'm updating my portfolio as I search for summer internships, and I'd
love to include a brief testimonial about the [project name] we worked
on together.

Would you be willing to share 2-3 sentences about:
- What challenge we solved
- What you appreciated about my work
- Any measurable results or impact

Example: "Gary's redesign of our website increased engagement by 30%.
His attention to user experience and creative problem-solving was
exceptional."

Thanks so much!

2. Remove `style="display: none;"` to reveal the section
3. Fill in the testimonial-card template with real quotes

---

#### 1.3 Add Real Metrics to Projects

Go through each project in your portfolio and ask:
